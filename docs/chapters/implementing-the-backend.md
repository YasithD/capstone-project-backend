## 2. Implementing the Backend

Implementing the Backend can be divided into 2 parts.

1. [Generating sample data for the Database](#21-generating-sample-data-for-the-database).
2. [Creating the functions to interact with the Database](#22-creating-the-functions-to-interact-with-the-database).
3. [Creating the Backend server](#23-creating-the-backend-server).

### 2.1. Generating sample data for the Database

> As mentioned in the [setting up the environment](/docs/chapters/setting-up-the-environment.md) section, we installed `sqlite3` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) to create the database instance of our application. Now, let's see how we can use that package in our application.

In your application's root, create a folder named `backend`. Inside the `backend` folder create a file named `database.js` to implement our database related functionalities.

First let's `import` the package with the following code.

```js
import sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';
```

Then initialize the database with the following code section.

```js
const db = new sqlite3.Database(':memory:');
```

> The above code returns a new `Database object` and it automatically opens the database. The `filename` argument `":memory:"` passed into the function creates an `anonymous in-memory database` and an `empty string for an anonymous disk-based database`. To get further details about the method, please visit this [link](https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3/wiki/API#new-sqlite3databasefilename-mode-callback).

Next, let's implement a function to add some dummy data to our database. We will call the function as `initializeDatabase`.

```js
export const initializeDatabase = () => {
    db.serialize(function () {
        // create teacher table and insert dummy records
        db.run('CREATE TABLE teacher (id INTEGER, name TEXT, age INTEGER)');
        db.run("INSERT INTO teacher values (10001, 'Kusuma Ranasinghe', 45)");
        db.run("INSERT INTO teacher values (10002, 'Saman De Silva', 40)");
        db.run("INSERT INTO teacher values (10003, 'Parasanna Mahagamage', 30)");
    
        // create student table and insert dummy records
        db.run(
            'CREATE TABLE student (id INTEGER, name TEXT, age INTEGER, religion TEXT)'
        );
        db.run(
            "INSERT INTO student values (20001, 'Supun Mihiranga', 10, 'Buddhist')"
        );
        db.run(
            "INSERT INTO student values (20002, 'Sandun Perera', 9, 'Catholic')"
        );
        db.run(
            "INSERT INTO student values (20003, 'Isuri De Silva', 10, 'Buddhist')"
        );
    });
};
```

- The SQLite query of the form `CREATE TABLE <table_name> (attribute_1, attribute_2, ...)` is used to create a table in the database. Here, a table named `teacher` and a table named `student` in created separately.
- The SQLite query of the form `INSERT INTO <table_name> values (value_1, value_2, ...)` is used to insert data to a table in the database. Here, dummy data is inserted into the `teacher` table and the `student` table we created.
- The `run` method of the `sqlite3 Database` is used to run a SQL query which doesn't retrieve any result data. Use the following [link](https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3/wiki/API#databaserunsql-param--callback) for further details about the method.

Since, we have now successfully initialized the database and added the dummy data, next let's create the methods for the `CRUD operations` related to the `teacher` class.

> Here, `CRUD operations` refers to `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete` operations of the data.

### 2.2. Creating the functions to interact with the Database

In this tutorial we will be guiding you to creating the functions for the `CRUD operations` of the teacher class.

#### First let's create the function for adding a teacher to the database.

```js
export const addTeacher = async (id, name, age) => {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        db.all(
            `INSERT INTO teacher values (${id}, '${name}', ${age})`,
            function (err, rows) {
                if (err != null) {
                    console.log(err);
                    reject({ status: 'error' });
                }
                console.log('Successfully inserted teacher into database');
                resolve({ status: 'successfully added teacher' });
            }
        );
    });
};
```

- Here a `Promise` is returned when a `teacher` object is created. A `Promise` object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value [[1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)]. A function can be passed into the `Promise` object with `resolve`, and `reject` methods to be called upon successfully completion or failure respectively.
- In the above code, when a teacher is successfully added to the database, the `resolve` method will return a `status` message as `"successfully added teacher"`. If any error is occurred during the creation of a teacher, the `reject` method will return a `status` message as `"error"`.
- The `all` method of the `sqlite3 Database` accepts a SQL query, and can be provided with the `callback function` to be run upon completion. The `callback function` includes parameters `err`, and `rows` which refers to any error occurred during the process and the resulting rows from the database. For further details about the method, refer to the following [link](https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3/wiki/API#databaseallsql-param--callback).


#### Secondly let's create the function for Reading the Information of the teachers in the database.

> Let's look at the database function to read/retrieve the teacher data from the database.

```js
export const readTeachers = async () => {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        db.all('SELECT * FROM teacher', function (err, rows) {
            if (err != null) {
                console.log(err);
                reject({ status: 'error' });
            }
            console.log('Successfully fetched teachers from database');
            resolve(rows);
        });
    });
};
```

- In the above code, all the teacher information in the teacher table is retrieved. The `resolve` method will return the database rows of the teacher table. If any error is occurred during the creation of a teacher, the `reject` method will return a `status` message as `"error"`.
- The SQLite query of the form `SELECT * FROM <table_name>` is used to retrieve all the data of a table in the database. Here, `*` is used to retrieve data of all the columns. Alternatively we can specify the column names of which the data should be retrieved.

#### Implementation of retrieving a single teacher object.

```js
export const readTeacherInfo = async (id) => {
    return new Promise(function(resolve,reject) {
        db.all(`SELECT * FROM teacher WHERE id = ${id}`, function(err, rows) {
            if(err != null){
                console.log(err);
                reject({"status": "error"})
            }
            console.log("Successfully fetched teacher info from database");
            resolve(rows)
        });
        
    });
}
```

- The `readTeacherInfo` method accepts an `id` parameter which is referring to the **teacher's id**.
- The `id` parameter is then used in the SQLite query with a `WHERE` clause to filter the specified teacher among all teachers.
- Similarly, the `all` method of the `db` will call the callback function passed to it upon completion of the query. If an error occurs it is returned via `err` and if not the results are returned via `rows`.

#### Next, let's implement the function for the delete operation of the teacher class.

```js
export const deleteTeacher = async id => {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        db.all(`DELETE FROM teacher WHERE id=${id}`, function (err, rows) {
            if (err != null) {
                console.log(err);
                reject({ status: 'error' });
            }
            console.log('Successfully deleted teacher from database');
            resolve({ status: 'successfully deleted teacher' });
        });
    });
};
```

- In SQLite, the SQL query format `DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <attribute_1>=<value_1> AND/OR ...` is used for deleting a row from the given table. In the above code the `teacher's id` value is used to identify the row to be deleted from the `teacher` table.

### 2.3. Creating the Backend server

Inside the `backend` folder we created in the [Generating sample data for the Database](#21-generating-sample-data-for-the-database) section, create a file named `server.js` to manage the Backend server.

#### Now let's first import the essentials to run our Backend server.

```js
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
import {
    initializeDatabase,
    readTeachers,
    readTeacherInfo,
    addTeacher,
    deleteTeacher,
} from "./database.js";
```

- `Express` is a Node.js framework that provides facilities to run the services we need to initiate the server. We will be creating APIs using `express` and the functions we created in last section. Express provides a robust set of features for web application creation.
- Middleware are functions that have access to the  request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. Middlewares are mainly used to reformat request object, response object or handle multimedia request (check on [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) for more information).
- The next import is the [`body-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser). It is a Node.js middleware which will parse the incoming request bodies before getting to the handlers. This is essential for validating the inputs received before the request proceeds and also convert the request body into JS datatype. Read more about [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser).
- The next set of imports are the functions we created in the `database.js` file which contains the functions we created and described above. In JavaScript and in many other programming languages the functions defined in a different file should be imported first before using this in another file. A such code containing file is called a Module. Read more about [Modules](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-modules-explained-with-examples/#:~:text=A%20module%20in%20JavaScript%20is,object%20accessible%20to%20other%20modules).

```js
const app = express();
```

- This creates the express framework object which is used to initialize our server. Read more on [express()](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)

```js
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());
```

- In this [app.use()](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) instructs the express object to use the middlewares passed as parameters. The first middleware passed is the [bodyparser.urlencoded()](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser.html) which Returns middleware that only parses urlencoded bodies and [bodyparser.json()](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser.html) instructs the request body should be in the json format.

```js
initializeDatabase();
```

- This runs the function we described in the [earlier section](#21-generating-sample-data-for-the-database) which adds a set of dummy data into the database.

#### Next step is to create APIs using the functions we created in the last section.

##### 1. API for retrieving teachers
```js
app.get("/listTeachers", async function (req, res) {
    console.log("Request received to list teachers");
    let data = await readTeachers();
    
    res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
    res.end(JSON.stringify(data));
});
```

- This is the API for retrieving the list of teachers using the `readTeachers` function.

> Depending on what we need to do with an API, different methods are used to send requests to the APIs. Following are the most commonly used methods.
> 1. `POST` - This method is used when an API is used to send data (*create*).
> 2. `GET` - This method is used when an API is used to retrieve data (*read*).
> 3. `PUT` - This method is used when an API is used to update already existing data (*update*).
> 4. `DELETE` - This method is used when an API is used to delete data (*delete*).
>
> As mentioned in the parentheses, these methods map to the `CRUD` operations.

- In the `express` module, we pass a `path` argument and a `callback` function to the `get` method. Here the `path` refers to the endpoint we will be using to call the API. The `callback` function contains a `Request` and a `Response` object which is denoted by `req` and `res` respectively. Those objects contain methods to manipulate the request and the response of the API. For further details, access the documentation of `express` using this [link](https://expressjs.com/).
- In the above example, the `readTeachers` API is accessed through a `get` method. The endpoint `/listTeachers` is used to direct the requests to the API.
- Note that an `async` function is used for the callback function. An `async` function are used to return a `Promise`. In the [section](#secondly-lets-create-the-function-for-reading-the-information-of-the-teachers-in-the-database) when we created the `readTeachers` function, note that a `Promise` is returned. To return this `Promise` value, an `async` function is used as the callback function of the `get` method. To access the `Promise` value, an `await` statement is used. This stops the execution of the function until the returned `Promise` is resolved or rejected.
- Finally, `res.setHeader()` is used to set the header values of the response, and `res.end()` is used to end the response process. For further details about the methods, use this [link](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#res).

#### 2. API for retrieving a single teacher

```js
app.post("/getTeacherInfo", async function (req, res) {
  let reqBody = req.body;
  console.log("Request received to get Teacher Info");
  let data = await readTeacherInfo(reqBody.id);

  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
  res.end(JSON.stringify(data));
});
```

- Using the above API we can get the information of a particular teacher identified through the teacher's id.
- This API is accessed through the URL `/getTeacherInfo` via a `post` request. The data required to identify the teacher (*teacher's id*) is passed as a javascript object in the following format.

```json
{
  "id": "teacher_id"
}
```

- This incoming data object can be captured by the `body` attribute of the `req` object.
- By triggering this API, a teacher with the specified `teacher_id` will be returned.

##### 3. API for adding/creating a teacher
```js
app.post("/addTeacher", async function (req, res) {
    let reqBody = req.body;
    console.log(
    "Request received to add teacher. Req body: " + JSON.stringify(reqBody)
    );
    let data = await addTeacher(reqBody.id, reqBody.name, reqBody.age);
    
    res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
    res.end(JSON.stringify(data));
});
```

- This is the API for creating/adding a teacher to the database via the `addTeacher` method we created earlier.
- Similar to the previous API, this API uses the endpoint `/addTeacher` to access the API via a `post` method/request. The data required to create the teacher object is passed to the `post` method as a javascript object in the following format.

```json
{
  "id": "teacher_id",
  "name": "teacher_name",
  "age": "teacher_age"
}
```

- By triggering this API, a teacher object will be created in the database with the specified details in the data object of the request.

##### 4. API for deleting a teacher
```js
app.post("/deleteTeacher", async function (req, res) {
    let reqBody = req.body;
    console.log(
    "Request received to delete teacher. Req body: " + JSON.stringify(reqBody)
    );
    let data = await deleteTeacher(reqBody.id);
    
    res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
    res.end(JSON.stringify(data));
});
```

- This API is used to delete a `teacher` object from the database using the `teacher's id` specified in the body of the `post` request.
- Similar to the above APIs, the endpoint `/deleteTeacher` is used via a `post` method/request to delete the teacher object. The `teacher's id` is passed in the data object of the request in the following format as a javascript object.

```json
{
  "id": "teacher_id"
}
```

- This will pass the `id` value to the `deleteTeacher` method, and eventually it will delete the teacher object from the database with the specified `id` value.

### 2.4. Running the server.

- When we check the `index.js` file we will the following code snippet

```js
import server from "./server.js";

server.listen(8080, function () {
  console.log(
    "Capstone Project Backend is running on http://localhost:8080"
  );
});
```

- Running this will activate the express server in port `8080` and you can send requests to this url.
- Read more on [server.listen()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-server-listen-method/).
- To run the Backend server, in the `project's root` open a terminal and run the following command.

```bash
npm start
```
