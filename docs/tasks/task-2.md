## Task 2

In this task section, we will be implementing the APIs for the `student's` database functions created in [task 1](/docs/tasks/task-1.md).

> Refer to [this](/docs/chapters/implementing-the-backend.md#33-creating-the-backend-server) section in the teacher class for further details.

Tasks to complete:
1. Create an API with the endpoint `/listStudents` to retrieve all students via a `get` request.
2. Create an API with the endpoint `/getStudentInfo` to retrieve a specified student via a `post` request.
3. Create an API with the endpoint `/addStudent` to add a student via a `post` request.
4. Create an API with the endpoint `/deleteStudent` to delete a specified student via a `post` request.

> **Important**: Use the exact `API endpoints` and the `request methods` given above when implementing the `student's` APIs. Differing endpoints may cause to lose marks.
