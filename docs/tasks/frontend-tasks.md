## Frontend Tasks

In this task section, you are required to implement a searching functionality for the `teacher` and `student` classes.

Task: Search a `teacher` or a `student` by his/her `name`.

Input: Any searching text >`String`.

Output: Update the `teacherData` array of the `teacher` class, and do the same for the `student` class.

> **Important**: Don't change the name of the `search` function. Differing names will cause to lose marks.
