## Task 1

Our first task is to implement the `Database Interaction Functions` for the `student` class.

> Refer to [this](/docs/chapters/implementing-the-backend.md#22-creating-the-functions-to-interact-with-the-database) section in the teacher class for further details.

Tasks to complete:
1. Create a `readStudents` function to read all student data.
2. Create a `readStudentInfo` function to read the information of a specified student.
3. Create a `addStudent` function to add a student.
4. Create a `deleteStudent` function to delete a specified student.

> **Important**: Use the exact `function names` given above when implementing the `student's` database functions. Differing name may cause to lose marks.
