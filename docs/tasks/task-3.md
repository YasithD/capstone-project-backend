## Task 3

If you have completed [task 1](/docs/tasks/task-1.md) and [task 2](/docs/tasks/task-2.md), you should have a complete backend for the `student`.

The next task is to create the frontend `Angular Components` for the `student` class.

Task to complete:
1. Create a component `add-new-student` to create the UI for adding a student.
2. Create a component `edit-student` to create the UI for editing student details.
3. Create a component `student-table` to create the UI for listing the students.

> **Important**: Use the exact `component names` given above when implementing the `student's` components. Differing component names may cause to lose marks.
